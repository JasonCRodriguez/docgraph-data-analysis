Hi,
     This is the proprietary-friendly license for the GraphDoc data set.

Feel free to use this data set in any way you like, with the exception of:

* Reselling the data in its raw form
* Making a tool that can be trivially scrapped for someone to get this data
* Otherwise enabling this dataset to go into the public domain without a license.

This license is for one corporate entity, in perpetuity.
New company = new license.

Otherwise, have at it. Use this data in any way you like.
Try to make the world a better place... but thats a suggestion, not a requirement.
